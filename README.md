*connects to the backend to make calls to a weather API for the 3-hour period/5-days predictions
*utilises geolocation API to pinpoint the user's location to get accurate results for the area
*connects to the backend to make calls to an image API to receive an image tailored to the weather conditions by using specific query parameters (if it's snowy it displays e.g. snowy mountains)
*displays a random 'fortune cookie' with the advice for the day from the fortune cookie database stored in MongoDb (via Mongoose)
